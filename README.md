File Access Management

User & Group Management: Integrate with Windows user and group management to set permissions.
Access Control Lists (ACLs): Allow the application to modify ACLs on files and directories.
Audit Logging: Track and log file access, modifications, and permission changes for auditing purposes.
Security Features
Permission Alerts: Notify users or admins when critical files or directories are accessed or modified.
Encryption & Decryption: Offer file encryption/decryption services to protect sensitive data.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implement RBAC to assign permissions based on user roles within the application.
File Integrity Monitoring
Integrity Checks: Regularly check files for unauthorized changes (e.g., using hash functions).
Version Control: Keep track of different versions of a file, with the ability to compare and restore previous versions.
File Locking: Prevent unauthorized access or changes to specific files by locking them.


By integrating these features, your Windows application would offer a robust set of tools for personal assistance, advanced data analysis, and technical support, all while ensuring that file system permissions are managed securely and efficiently.
